# The Investigator

An AI-powered security & network analyst I'm building across 8 weeks.

## Skills so far
  - Week 1: general security Q&A and clear explanations.
  - Week 2: can triage suspicious emails — check headers
    (SPF/DKIM/DMARC, Reply-To), flag urgency/secrecy/authority,
    recommend out-of-band verification.
  - Week 3: Can audit server logs for failed-login and brute-force 
    patterns (see audit.py)
  - Week 4: Can hunt network beaconing (hunt.py) and reconstruct an incident timeline 
    from multiple logs to guide response (timeline.py)
  - Week 5: Runs an automated triage pipeline (GitHub Actions + a local Llama 3.2 
    model via Ollama) that reads the IR runbook, maps findings to MITRE ATT&CK, and 
    writes a verified incident report
  - Week 6: A Streamlit SOC Copilot that correlates four telemetry sources 
    (firewall, Sysmon, Windows, Suricata) via Groq and returns a triaged report
    with MITRE mapping, severity, and response plan.
